                            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet 
                            (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range 
                            from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, 
                            electronic businesses, and social network services. Web development is not 
                            concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding 
                            and programming that powers the website’s functionality.
